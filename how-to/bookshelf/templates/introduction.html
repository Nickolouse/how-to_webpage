<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div>
  <p>This guide assumes that the reader has experience programming in an object oriented language. It will also be
    helpful to have some understanding of Android Studio and android development. To develop the demo apps we will be
    using Android Studio. There will be a few demo apps that start out quite simple and then become more advanced.</p>
  <p>Async tasks are a built in tool for Android development that many encounter but I think few actually understand how
    to utilize. Async tasks are threads that are specifically for the UI. An advantage of doing more processor intensive
    calculations is that the UI will be more responsive. They can be especially useful when working with databases for
    forms and other large data interactions.</p>
  <p>Async tasks should not be used for calculations taking more than a couple seconds. These specialized threads execute
    in multiple stages to give defined order to the thread. These stages are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>onPreExecute - This method is called before doInBackground. This is where initializations should be performed.</li>
    <li>doInBackground - This method is where the calculations should be performed in your Async task.</li>
    <li>onProgressUpdate - This method can be called from doInBackground to update data in the UI thread.</li>
    <li>onPostExecute - This method is called last and is where connections should be closed and other cleanup steps.</li>
    <li>onCancel - This method can be used if you would like to have something like a cancel button where the user can
    cancel the activity they started. </li>
  </ul>
